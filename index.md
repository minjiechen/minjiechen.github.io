Thus, as of June 2024 every member of my former lab at TU Delft has graduated. 
- <img src="../img/fireworks.png" height="30px"> We are nearing the end of my former TU Delft lab. Another PhD is in the books: Arthur Barbosa Câmara did an amazing job and defended his thesis [Designing Search-as-Learning Systems](https://doi.org/10.4233/uuid:0fe3a6bb-1bc1-40e2-86b0-ec3d3aef9c77).

## <img src="../img/career.png" height="50px"> My career
For a brief and compact overview, take a look at my 1-page [CV](../documents/Hauff_shortCV.pdf). 

I joined Spotify in August 2021, initially for a sabbatical from my academic job but then switched to a permanent role as a staff research scientist in April 2022.

After a 2-year stint as a Postdoc, I worked as a faculty member at the [Web Information Systems group](http://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/), [Delft University of Technology](http://www.tudelft.nl/) between 2013 and 2023. In 2016 and 2017 I received two prestigious personal grants from the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) with a total funding of more than 1 million euros; this translated into several PhD/postdoc positions in the developing "search as learning" research area. Take a look at the [Dagstuhl Seminar](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=17092) I co-organized on the topic to get an idea of what it was all about. 

I received my PhD in 2010 from the [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/), where I worked in the 
[Human Media Interaction group](http://hmi.ewi.utwente.nl/).

The [Otto-von-Guericke University of Magdeburg](https://www.uni-magdeburg.de/) in Germany was 
my home during my undergraduate years as a student in computer science.

In the past, I have worked on a variety of topics in the fields of information retrieval & data science, 
including query performance prediction (the topic of [my PhD thesis](../documents/publications/thesis.pdf)), 
social search, collaborative search, learning analytics, search as learning and IR for specific user groups.
