We develop power electronics systems for humanity and for the future world. We create new fundamental knowledge and push the boundaries of power electronics to enable important and emerging applications.

Our research spans across the full stack of power electronics ranging from theories to applications, from architecture to control, and from design methods to artificial intelligence. Our current focus include:

- Power electronics <a href="#">theories</a>
- Power electronics <a href="#">materials</a>
- Power electronics <a href="#">applications</a>
- Power electronics <a href="#">design methods</a>
- Power electronics <a href="#">artificial intelligence</a>
