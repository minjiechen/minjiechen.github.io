We develop future power conversion systems at Princeton University. We create new knowledge in power electronics to enable important and emerging applications.

Our research spans across the full stack of power electronics ranging from theories to applications, from architecture to control. Our current research focuses include:

- Smarter power electronics at the grid edge
- Smaller power electronics for robotics and EVs
- Ultra-efficient power electronics for information and artificial intelligence systems
- Design methods and software tools for power electronics and system architectures
