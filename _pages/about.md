We are a team of electrical engineers reimaging future power conversion systems with a diversity of expertise and a convergence of mission. We aim at making fundamental breakthroughs in power electronics to enable important and emerging applications.

Currently, our group focuses on next generation power electronics solutions for the following four important research areas:
- Smarter power electronics at the grid edge
- Smaller power electronics for robotics and EVs
- Ultra-Efficient power electronics for information and data systems
- Design methods and software tools for power electronics and system architectures

# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
