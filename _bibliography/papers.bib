abstract={Metamaterials with multimodal deformation mechanisms resemble machines1,2, especially when endowed with autonomous functionality. A representative architected assembly, with tunable chirality, converts linear motion into rotation3. These chiral metamaterials with a machine-like dual modality have potential use in areas such as wave manipulation4, optical activity related to circular polarization5 and chiral active fluids6. However, the dual motions are essentially coupled and cannot be independently controlled. Moreover, they are restricted to small deformation, that is, strain ≤2{\%}, which limits their applications. Here we establish modular chiral metamaterials, consisting of auxetic planar tessellations and origami-inspired columnar arrays, with decoupled actuation. Under single-degree-of-freedom actuation, the assembly twists between 0{\textdegree} and 90{\textdegree}, contracts in-plane up to 25{\%} and shrinks out-of-plane more than 50{\%}. Using experiments and simulations, we show that the deformation of the assembly involves in-plane twist and contraction dominated by the rotating-square tessellations and out-of-plane shrinkage dominated by the tubular Kresling origami arrays. Moreover, we demonstrate two distinct actuation conditions: twist with free translation and linear displacement with free rotation. Our metamaterial is built on a highly modular assembly, which enables reprogrammable instability, local chirality control, tunable loading capacity and scalability. Our concept provides routes towards multimodal, multistable and reprogrammable machines, with applications in robotic transformers, thermoregulation, mechanical memories in hysteresis loops, non-commutative state transition and plug-and-play functional assemblies for energy absorption and information encryption.},

pages={12-24},
abstract={This paper presents a comprehensive overview of circuits and magnetics co-design for point-of-load voltage regulator modules (VRMs), which delivers power to microprocessors such as CPUs and GPUs that require low voltages and high currents. We examine the recent shift from the 12-volt to the 48-volt architecture to achieve higher efficiency and power density, and discuss the challenges associated with direct 48-volt power conversion to the point of load below 1 volt. Power delivery architectures for 48-volt VRMs are systematically reviewed and categorized, with emphasis placed the opportunities and challenges of circuits--magnetics co-design for energy efficiency, power density, and control bandwidth. Magnetic components, such as inductors and transformers, are essential components in VRMs, and a discussion on available materials and their limitations is provided. A comprehensive design approach for ultra-thin vertical multiphase coupled magnetics, including modeling magnetic core losses with machine learning, is detailed. This review paper aims to disseminate the progress and challenges in circuit and magnetics co-design, while outlining a vision for future advancements in device technology, magnetic materials, and packaging techniques including hybrid-switched-capacitor and coupled magnetics technologies.},

  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
