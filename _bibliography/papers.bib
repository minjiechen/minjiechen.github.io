  abstract={Metamaterials with multimodal deformation mechanisms resemble machines1,2, especially when endowed with autonomous functionality. A representative architected assembly, with tunable chirality, converts linear motion into rotation3. These chiral metamaterials with a machine-like dual modality have potential use in areas such as wave manipulation4, optical activity related to circular polarization5 and chiral active fluids6. However, the dual motions are essentially coupled and cannot be independently controlled. Moreover, they are restricted to small deformation, that is, strain ≤2{\%}, which limits their applications. Here we establish modular chiral metamaterials, consisting of auxetic planar tessellations and origami-inspired columnar arrays, with decoupled actuation. Under single-degree-of-freedom actuation, the assembly twists between 0{\textdegree} and 90{\textdegree}, contracts in-plane up to 25{\%} and shrinks out-of-plane more than 50{\%}. Using experiments and simulations, we show that the deformation of the assembly involves in-plane twist and contraction dominated by the rotating-square tessellations and out-of-plane shrinkage dominated by the tubular Kresling origami arrays. Moreover, we demonstrate two distinct actuation conditions: twist with free translation and linear displacement with free rotation. Our metamaterial is built on a highly modular assembly, which enables reprogrammable instability, local chirality control, tunable loading capacity and scalability. Our concept provides routes towards multimodal, multistable and reprogrammable machines, with applications in robotic transformers, thermoregulation, mechanical memories in hysteresis loops, non-commutative state transition and plug-and-play functional assemblies for energy absorption and information encryption.},

  abstract={This paper presents a comprehensive overview of circuits and magnetics co-design for point-of-load voltage regulator modules (VRMs), which delivers power to microprocessors such as CPUs and GPUs that require low voltages and high currents. We examine the recent shift from the 12-volt to the 48-volt architecture to achieve higher efficiency and power density, and discuss the challenges associated with direct 48-volt power conversion to the point of load below 1 volt. Power delivery architectures for 48-volt VRMs are systematically reviewed and categorized, with emphasis placed the opportunities and challenges of circuits--magnetics co-design for energy efficiency, power density, and control bandwidth. Magnetic components, such as inductors and transformers, are essential components in VRMs, and a discussion on available materials and their limitations is provided. A comprehensive design approach for ultra-thin vertical multiphase coupled magnetics, including modeling magnetic core losses with machine learning, is detailed. This review paper aims to disseminate the progress and challenges in circuit and magnetics co-design, while outlining a vision for future advancements in device technology, magnetic materials, and packaging techniques including hybrid-switched-capacitor and coupled magnetics technologies.},

  abstract = {Abstract Transparent photovoltaics (TPVs) can be integrated into the surfaces of buildings and vehicles to provide point-of-use power without impacting aesthetics. Unlike TPVs that target the photon-rich near-infrared portion of the solar spectrum, TPVs that harvest ultraviolet (UV) photons can have significantly higher transparency and color neutrality, offering a superior solution for low-power electronics with stringent aesthetic tolerance. In addition to being highly transparent and colorless, an ideal UV-absorbing TPV should also be operationally stable and scalable over large areas while still outputting sufficient power for its specified application. None of today's TPVs meet all these criteria simultaneously. Here, the first UV-absorbing TPV is demonstrated that satisfies all four criteria by using CsPbCl2.5Br0.5 as the absorber. By precisely tuning the halide ratio during thermal co-evaporation, high-quality large-area perovskite films can be accessed with an ideal absorption cutoff for aesthetic performance. The resulting TPVs exhibit a record average visible transmittance of 84.6\% and a color rendering index of 96.5, while maintaining an output power density of 11 W m−2 under one-sun illumination. Further, the large-area prototypes up to 25 cm2 are demonstrated, that are operationally stable with extrapolated lifetimes of >20 yrs under outdoor conditions.},

  journal = {Superconductor Science and Technology},
  abstract = {Modeling of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors typically requires custom simulations or finite-element analysis in one or two dimensions. Here, we demonstrate two simplified one-dimensional SPICE models of a superconducting nanowire that can quickly and efficiently describe the electrical characteristics of a superconducting nanowire. These models may be of particular use in understanding alternative architectures for nanowire detectors and readouts.}
